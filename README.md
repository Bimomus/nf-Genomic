## The Results

As a theory for point mutation (substitutions), from transition (C<T; T<C) (A<G; G<A) will be easy in chemically happen in realization. Besides that, tranversion (C<A/G; T<A/G) vice versa, will be hard in chemically happen in realization, with the ratio is transition:tranversion (1:20). And from the results in the table, we know the T<C or C<T have higher mutation than others. Which is the T/C (Pirimidine) is simple one cyclic, than A/G (Purine) is two cyclic.
